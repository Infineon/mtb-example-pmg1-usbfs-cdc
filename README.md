## Hardware setup

See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Connect the PMG1 kit to your PC using a USB-C cable through the KitProg3 USB Type-C port (J1).

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Ensure that the steps listed in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section are completed.

2. Ensure that the jumper shunt on the power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=PMG1-CY7112 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
</details>

4. After programming the kit, disconnect the USB cable and change the position on the power selection jumper (J5) to 1-2 to power the kit through the PMG1 USB PD sink port (J10).

5. Connect the PMG1 kit to the PC using a USB cable through the PMG1 USB PD sink port (J10).

6. On the PC, verify that a new USB device was enumerated as a Virtual COM port.

**Figure 1. Device Manager - Virtual COM port**

<img src = "images/device_manager_snippet.png" width = "400">

7. Run any terminal emulator program of your choosing and make a new connection to the virtual COM port.

8. Type any message in the terminal and observe each character echoing back to the window.

Note that Tera Term is a terminal which sends characters out as they are received and does not require you to press **Enter** to send messages. Therefore, characters are echoed back individually rather than sentences at a time. Other terminal applications may not send any characters out until **Enter** is pressed; thus, the entire sentence is echoed back to the terminal.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf).


## Design and implementation

In the main firmware routine, the USB Device block is configured to use the Communication Device Class (CDC). After enumeration, the device constantly checks if any data (single character or a series of characters) was received from the host. If any data is available, the application copies the received data to a buffer in the SRAM and sends the same data back to the host.

### Device configuration

Do the following to view the CDC descriptor:

1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down to the **Tools** section, and click **Device Configurator 3.10**.

3. Once the Device Configurator opens, navigate to the **Peripherals** tab. Then select/click the Communication Peripheral **Universal Serial Bus (USB) 0**. This opens the USB configuration fields. Note that the USB Peripheral personality is set as **USBFS Device-1.0**.

   **Figure 3. Universal Serial Bus (USB) 0 configuration using Device Configurator 3.10**

<img src = "images/usbdeviceconfigurator.png" width = "800">

### USB configuration

1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down to the **Tools** section, and click **USB Configurator 2.4**.

3. On the USB Configurator opens, refer to the following images for some important Descriptor Configurations.

   Device Descriptor field <b>bDeviceClass</b> names a class that the device/kit belongs to. A value of 0x02 indicates that the device/kit is a communications device. In addition, two endpoint descriptors are added which act as buffers storing the received data or data waiting to be transmitted. An important field in these endpoint descriptors is **bEndpointAddress(7):direction**. One endpoint is defined as IN and provides the data to send to the host while another endpoint is defined as OUT and stores data received from the host.
